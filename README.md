# RigidLinearRotor-PIMCD
This code performs rigid body rotations and translations for linear molecules. Rotation sampling is done using Metropolis Path Integral Monte Carlo and translation sampling is done using rejection-free Path Integral Molecular Dynamics using the Langevin equation thermostat.
